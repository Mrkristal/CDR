The CDR project is open-source solution for content disarm and reconstruction at Mailboxes. 
The CDR works by processing all incoming e-mails in a spesific network, deconstructing them, and removing the elements that do not match the file type's standards or set policies. 
CDR technology then rebuilds the e-mail into clean versions that can be sent on to end users as intended.

The project created by Elad Kristal and Shahar Hazan for Achva Collage.
